	<h3><a id="basis_states">How to define basis states</a></h3>
	
	<p>The most basic, straightforward and simple way is to enlist all configurations explicitly.</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">params["active_space"] = range(12,21)  # [12,20]

params["states"] = []
params["states"].append(["GS",[12,-12,13,-13]])    # 0

params["states"].append(["S1",[12,-12,-13,19]])    # 1
params["states"].append(["S2",[-12,13,-13,19]])    # 2

params["states"].append(["D1",[12,-12,19,-19]])    # 3
params["states"].append(["D2",[-12,13,19,-19]])    # 4
 </pre>
 
	<p>In the code above the first thing one always needs to define is the active space - a list of KS orbitals that are or may be occupied in the basis
	Slater determinants (configurations) defined afterwards. In the current example we specify that the orbitals from 12 to 20 including may be involved in
	construction of the basis states</p>
	<p>The second step is to define the basis states. Each state is encoded by the variable of type list. The list contains at least 2 items: first - the
	label of the state (of type string), second - the list of integers that identify which orbitals are occupied by each of 4 electrons available in
	active space (with positive numbers corresponding to spin-up or alpha electrons, and the negative numbers corresponding to spin-down or beta electrons)</p>
	<p>Why there are 4 electrons in the active space in example presented above? This depends on how many occupied orbitals are likely to be involved
	in excitations in particular systems. In our case we only consider two frontier occupied orbitals HOMO-1 (index 12), and HOMO (index 13). Therefore, only
	4 electrons need to be distributed among the orbital pool from 12 to 20. When all 4 electrons occupy the lowest orbitals (HOMO-1 and HOMO) - this corresponds 
	to the ground state configuration: [12, -12, 13, -13], which is labeled with "GS". Promotion of one electron from either HOMO or HOMO-1 to any of the
	unoccupied orbital will result in a singly-excited state (e.g. S1 - in which an electron is promoted from the spin-orbital 13 to the spin-orbital 19, or 
	S2 in which an electron is promoted from spin-orbital 12 to spin-orbital 19). Promotion of 2 electrons will result in a doubly excited states, such as 
	D1 and D2</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>Definition of the states in the form presented above allows the user to adjust the average energy of the state according to specific needs. For
	example, the DFT band gaps are often underestimated w.r.t. experimental or high-level ab initio results. As a consequence, the excitation energies
	may be underestimated. The other situation where the energy adjustment may be needed is for describing multi-electron excited states. For example, the
	energy of D1 or D2 states in organic crystals (e.g. in solid pentacene) may be comparable to the energy of singly-excited states S1 and S2, while the
	computational model based on sums of the KS-orbital energies would notably overestimate the excitation energies of the D1 and D2 states. Finally, one
	may simply be interested to study the charge or energy transfer rate as a function of the energy gap, with the latter considered as a variable.</p>
	<p>The energy correction can be specific for each state and is defined as a third parameter in state definition (of float type):</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">params["active_space"] = range(12,21)  # [12,20]

params["states"] = []
params["states"].append(["GS",[12,-12,13,-13], 0.00])    # 0

params["states"].append(["S1",[12,-12,-13,19]], 0.5)    # 1
params["states"].append(["S2",[-12,13,-13,19]], 0.5)    # 2

params["states"].append(["D1",[12,-12,19,-19]], -1.5)    # 3
params["states"].append(["D2",[-12,13,19,-19]], -1.5)    # 4
 </pre>	
	<p>In the code above we have adjusted energies of states so to affect the excitation energies. In particular, the excitation energies of the 0->1 (GS->S1)
	and 0->2 (GS->S2) transitions have been increased by 0.5 eV, while the energies of the D1 and D2 states has been lowered by 1.5 eV.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>More compact way to define the basis states is by using the <b>lazy</b> module, as it is used in the tutorial examples:</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">Nmin = 12
HOMO=13
Nmax=20	
# Set active space and the basis states
params["active_space"] = range(Nmin,Nmax+1)

# Generate basis states
GS = lazy.ground_state(Nmin,HOMO)  # ground state
SE = lazy.single_excitations(Nmin,Nmax,HOMO,1)  # single excitations

# Now combine the ground and singly excited states in one list
# In our convention, the GS configuration must be the first state in the
# list of the basis states.
params["states"] = []
params["states"].append(GS)
for se in SE:
    params["states"].append(se)
 </pre>		
	<p>The script will work similarly to those presented above, except now ALL possible single excitations from any of occupied orbitals to any unoccupied orbitals
	included in active space will be constructed. In this case the occupied orbitals are defined as all the orbitals in the range from Nmin to HOMO (including ends)
	 and the unoccupied orbitals are defined as those in the range from HOMO+1 to Nmax (including ends). Note, that the "occupied orbitals" in this need not
	 have the conventional physical meaning. Instead, if one considers the "hot" electron relaxation or el-el scattering in the CB manifolds without paying attention
	 to accross-the-gap transitions (LUMO->HOMO), one may simply redefine the parameters Nmin, HOMO and Nmax according to the specific problem. So
	 in our example, if we are interested in "hot" electron relaxation to LUMO (orbital 14) from any other CB orbital, then one can re-define Nmin=14,HOMO=14 and Nmax=20.
	 In this case the "ground state"(first excited state) configuration will be defined by [14,-14], while the "hot" electron (higher excited) states will be
    [14,-15], [14,-16],...[14,-20]</p>

	<h3><a id="nac">How to scale NACs</a></h3>
	<p>Occasionally one may need to effectively exclude the possibility of transitions to specific states, one may be interested to study the dependence of 
	the charge and/or energy transfer rates as a function of NAC magnitude, or one may simply need to correct the NAC scale to better agree with experiment or
	higher-level ab initio calculations. For these and similar purposes, the PYXAID code recognizes the key-word "nac_scale" in the input parameters dictionary:</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">
# Below is a small snippet that scales all NACs by 1.0 (so no practical effect)
nmicrost = len(params["states"]) # number of (micro)states
params["nac_scale"] = []
for i in range(0,nmicrost):
    for j in range(0,nmicrost):
        params["nac_scale"].append([i,j,1.0])  

 </pre>	
	<p>The format is straightforward - the params["nac_scale"] is a list of items. Each item is list of 3 components - 2 integers and 1 float. The two integers
	define the indices of the pairs of the basis states, and the floating-point value defines the factor by which the NAC between these pair of states will be
	scaled. So, as in the example above, all pairs of NACs will be scaled by 1.0, so no effect will be observed. To shut down the transitions for state I to
	state J do:</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">
        params["nac_scale"].append([I,J,0.0])  
		params["nac_scale"].append([J,I,0.0])  
 </pre>		
	<p>Don't forget that the NAC matrix should stay anti-symmetric all the time, so if some (i,j) element of the NAC matrix is scaled by some constant K,
	the transpose element (j,i) should be scaled by the same constant K.</p>
	
	
	<h3><a id="iconds">How to define initial conditions</a></h3>
	<p>The initial conditions are defined by the value of the input parameter dictionary with the keyword "iconds", params["iconds"]. The object params["iconds"]
	is a list of items. Each item is a list itsef, composed of 2 values - both of which are or the integer type. The first value indicates at which time step
	of originally precomputed MD trajectory do we start our NA-MD calculations, the second integer indicates the state (one of the basis states) in which the
	system is initially prepared. In the simplest case the definition of the initial conditions can look like:</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">
ex_indx = 2
params["iconds"] = [ [0,ex_indx],[50,ex_indx],[100,ex_indx] ]
 </pre>		
	<p>In the snippet above we consider initial excitation ex_indx = 2 but starting at times 0, 50 and 100 steps since the beginning of the MD trajectory
	(normally these numbers correspond to time in fs)</p>
	<p>A slightly more elaborate version of the initial conditions definition will be:</p>
<pre class="brush: python;">
# Initial conditions
nmicrost = len(params["states"]) # number of (micro)states
ic = []
i = 0
while i < 10:
    j = 0
    while j < nmicrost:
        ic.append([50*i,j])
        j = j + 1
    i = i + 1
params["iconds"] = ic
 </pre>			
	<p>In this example we consider nmicrost initial excitation - that is considering what would happen to each individual basis state. For each state we
	consider evolution with the NA-MD starting at 0, 50, 100, 150, ... 450 time step of initially pre-computed MD trajectory.</p>
	
	
	<h3><a id="all_in_one">How to use a single file that contains both imaginary (off-diagonal) and real (diagonal) parts of Hamiltonian</a></h3>
	
	<p>This is achieved via a new option for params["read_couplings"] - "online_all_in_one". In this case the prefixes to real and imaginary components
	of Hamiltonian should be set to the same value, pointing to a given file that combines both parts. For example,</p>
	<pre class="brush: python;">params["Ham_re_prefix"] = rt+"/0_Ham_"
params["Ham_re_suffix"] = ""
params["Ham_im_prefix"] = rt+"/0_Ham_"
params["Ham_im_suffix"] = ""

...

params["read_couplings"] = "online_all_in_one"
