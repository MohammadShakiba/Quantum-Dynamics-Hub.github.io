case1 : NVE simulation with initially setup velocities (no preliminary cooling)

In the following two case we run NVT (isolated system, no PBC) calculations with
several preliminary rounds of cooling

case2 :  "nu_therm":0.01  - okay 

case3 :  "nu_therm":0.001 - the invariant is conserved much better
