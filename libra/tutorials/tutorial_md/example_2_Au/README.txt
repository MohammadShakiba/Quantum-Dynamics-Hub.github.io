
case1 :  original UFF parameters for Au (cation)
         simulation as a cluster, NVT

case2 :  Au epsilon is scaled by the factor of 10
         simulation as a cluster, NVT

case3 :  Au epsilon is increased even more, vdw radius is decreased a bit
         simulation as a cluster, NVT

case4 :  Au parameters is as in case 2
         simulation as a periodic system, NVT
         note that the type of interactions is now changed, since we now need to use PBC

case5 :  -- NPT simulations in periodic: (failng now) --
