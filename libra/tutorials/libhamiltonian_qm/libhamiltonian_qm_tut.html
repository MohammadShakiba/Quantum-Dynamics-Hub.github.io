          <h3>Libhamiltonian_qm Tutorials</h3><br>
		  
		  The "libhamiltonian_qm" is a sub-module of the "libhamiltonian_atomistic" module. The "libhamiltonian_qm" implements quantum-mechanical Hamiltonians 
		  for atomistic calculations. The working files showing how to use
		  different objects are located in the /tests/test_hamiltonian_qm directory of the Libra package.
		  Most of the tutorials are almost completely self-explanatory. Here, we only focus on most interesting/less straightforward conventions and 
		  articulate some of our actions.
		  
		  <br><br>
		  <b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_hamiltonian_qm/test_qm1.py" target="_new">test_qm1.py</a></b><br><br>
		  <p> Alright, lets start with this first script. Well, this one is gonna be pretty extensive, since it shows many different features available.
		  However, once this is done, we should be able to understand other examples much faster.
		  </p>
		  <ol>
		  <li><b>Set up universe and create molecular system.</b>Well, we start with already familiar (from 
		  <a href="../libhamiltonian_mm/libhamiltonian_mm_tut.html" target="_new">libhamiltonian_mm</a> tutorials - see it first, if you haven't done so) procedures to setup Universe,
		  and load molecular system. In our first example, the sistem is very simple - just a single carbon atom. 
		  </li>
		  <li><b>Load Control and Model parameters.</b>Next, we create two objects that will contain all parameters controlling our calculations. The first object is of class "Control_Parameters":
		  <pre class="brush: python;">prms = Control_Parameters()
get_parameters_from_file("control_parameters_indo.dat", prms)
#get_parameters_from_file("control_parameters_eht.dat", prms)
		  </pre>		  
		  This object is constructed using the specially-formatted file, which sets up all detials on what type of calculations to be performed and how.
		  For the list of accepted options provided in the input file, refer to the 
		  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/hamiltonian/Hamiltonian_Atomistic/Hamiltonian_QM/Control_Parameters/Control_Parameters.h" target="_new">Control_Parameters class</a>
		  In the snippet above we have two options for calculations - either INDO or EHT. If we want the latter - just uncomment the second line and comment the
		  first. Loading one of those configuration/control files will then affect which parameter files will be used (as defined in the control file) and 
		  which additional actions we will be performing (according to the correspondingly set up options of the "prms" object).
		  <p>The second object is of class "Model_Parameters". It contains the Hamiltonian-specific set of parameters. We first construct a default object using
		  <pre class="brush: python;">modprms = Model_Parameters()</pre>
		  And then, depending on the type of Hamiltonian we are looking to construct, we load Hamiltonian-specific information - from some parameters input
		  file:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">if(prms.hamiltonian=="eht"):
    set_parameters_eht(prms, modprms)
elif(prms.hamiltonian=="indo"):
    set_parameters_indo(prms, modprms);
          </pre>
		  The expected formats of the files with the parameters are different for INDO and EHT calculations. In addition, for EHT, we have extra cards that
		  are used for advanced customization of the Hamiltonian (e.g. self-consistent EHT, adding atomic pseudopotentials, etc.). To learn more on the
		  expected formats and on the units of the parameters, refer to the 
		  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/hamiltonian/Hamiltonian_Atomistic/Hamiltonian_QM/Model_Parameters/Model_Parameters_INDO.cpp" target="_new">Model_Parameters_INDO.cpp</a>
		  and
		  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/hamiltonian/Hamiltonian_Atomistic/Hamiltonian_QM/Model_Parameters/Model_Parameters_EHT.cpp" target="_new">Model_Parameters_EHT.cpp</a>
		  files for INDO and EHT setups, respectively.
		  </p>
		  </li>		  
		  <li><b>Create AO basis and mappings.</b>
		  When we know the number of atoms and their types and positions, we can dress them with atomic orbitals (AO). Each atomic orbital is treated as an
		  independent object. The AO basis, hence, is essentially a list of AO objects. The specifics of the AO depend on the basis type chosen. Presently,
		  we use only STO-3G(double zeta) basis. The main procedure here is:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">basis_ao, Nelec, Norb, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map = set_basis_STO_3G_DZ(mol_at_types, R, modprms, verb) </pre>
		  The rest of this section (actually the instructions preceeding this line)  are simply preparations of the input arguments, so they would be of
		  expected type. In this preparation, we heavily use the exported complex data types:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">mol_at_types = StringList()
R = VECTORList()
basis = AOList()
atom_to_ao_map = intMap()
ao_to_atom_map = intList()
		  </pre>
		  The first one is a list of strings (vector&ltstring&gt in C++), the second - is the list of VECTOR objects (vector&ltVECTOR&gt in C++), the
		  third - is the list of AO objects (vector&ltAO&gt in C++), the last one the list of integers (vector&ltint&gt in C++), and finally, the one before
		  the last is the list of lists of integers - in that sense in is a map that mapps one integer onto the other (hence its type name) - it corresponds to
		  vector&lt &ltint&gt &gt in C++. 
		  <p>The beauty of Python is that the functions are allowed to return several results (essentially, this is a tuple containing several entries). This is
		  what we use in the function call above. Let us briefly discuss what is returned.
		  </p>
		  <ul>
			<li><b>basis_ao</b> - is the list of objects of AO type - our Atomic Orbitals</li>
			<li><b>Nelec, Norb</b> - the numbers of electrons and orbitals for the system of interest</li>
			<li><b>atom_to_ao_map</b> - the map that puts the correspondence between atomic indices and indices of atomic orbitals on each atom.
			Specifically, atom_to_ao_map[i] is a list of indices of all AOs localized on the atom with index i</li>
			<li><b>ao_to_atom_map</b> - the map which is in a sense inverse of the atom_to_ao_map. Specifically, ao_to_atom_map[i] is the index of the atom
			on which the AO with index i resides.</li>
		  </ul>		  
		  </li>
		  
		  <br>
		  <li><b>for EHT: load and pre-process the parameters that are specific to EHT Hamiltonian. </b>
		  <p>This is done via two special functions:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">set_parameters_eht_mapping(modprms, basis_ao)
set_parameters_eht_mapping1(modprms,syst.Number_of_atoms,mol_at_types)</pre>
		  Also note that "modprms" argument also is being modified, since it is passed by the reference. See more on what these functions are doing in
		  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/hamiltonian/Hamiltonian_Atomistic/Hamiltonian_QM/Model_Parameters/Model_Parameters.cpp" target="_new">Model_Parameters.cpp</a>
		  file.
		  </p>
		  </li>
		  
		  <br>
		  <li><b>compute AO overlap matrices</b>
		  <p>Since we are doing only single-point calculations in this tutorial, the overlap matrix in the AO basis is not changed, and can be computed only
		  once. The calculations are performed with:</p>
		  <pre class="brush: python;">update_overlap_matrix(x_period, y_period, z_period, t1, t2, t3, basis_ao, Sao)</pre>
		  <p>Here, matrix Sao is passed by reference, so it'll collect all the results. Other arguments are the input parameters. The x_period, y_period,
		  and z_period parameters set up how many of replica of the original unit cell should be produced in the corresponding directions. This is needed
		  for periodic calculations and affect the way the overal elements are computed. The parameters t1, t2, t3 are the unit cell vectors, defining the
		  translations of the unit cell in all directions (not necessarily just x, y, z - these are only names, in reality t1, t2, t3 can be non-orthogonal
		  to each other). </p>
		  </li>
		  
		  <br>
		  <li><b>compute the core Hamiltonian</b>
		  <p>Once the overlap matrix is computed, the core Hamiltonians can be computed. For the EHT Hamiltonian, the core Hamiltonian is directly related to
		  the overlap matrix, so no special preparations are required:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">elif(prms.hamiltonian=="eht"):
    Hamiltonian_core_eht(syst, basis_ao, prms, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map, Hao,  Sao, debug)
		  </pre>
		  In case of INDO and related (CNDO and CNDO/2 are requested by setting "opt" parameter to 1) Hamiltonians, the overlap of atomic orbitals is assumed
		  to be identiry matrix, which is set by:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">Sao.Init_Unit_Matrix(1.0)</pre>
		  In addition, some core Hamiltonian parameters (electron repulsion and nuclear-nuclear potentials) must be pre-computed. This is done via:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">indo_core_parameters(syst, basis_ao, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map, opt,0)</pre>
		  Note that, as a part of our efficiency optimization scheme, the derivatives of the resulting parameters with respect to all nuclei will be 
		  written as a bunch of binary files. The derivatives of the electron repulsion (ERI) integrals, will appear as files named like "deri.x_0.bin",
		  "deri.y_0.bin", "deri.z_0.bin", "deri.x_1.bin", "deri.y_1.bin", ..., "deri.x_N.bin", "deri.y_N.bin", "deri.z_N.bin" and "dV_AB.x_0.bin",
		  "dV_AB.y_0.bin", "dV_AB.z_0.bin", ... , "dV_AB.x_N.bin", "dV_AB.y_N.bin", "dV_AB.z_N.bin". These are the temporary files (although they are
		  not removed automatically yet). They are used during calculations of core and Fock Hamiltonians. 
		  </p>
		  </li>
		  
		  <br>
		  <li><b>compute eigenvalues/eigenvectors, populations, and density matrix</b>
		  Once the core Hamiltonian is formed, we can compute the corresponding eigenvalues and eigenvectors, populations, orbital energies, and 
		  density matrix. The following operations are described in the <a href="../libcalculators/libcalculators_tut.html" target="_new">libcalculators tutorial</a>.
		  </li>
		  </ol>
		  
		  
		  <br><br>
		  <b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_hamiltonian_qm/test_qm2.py" target="_new">test_qm2.py</a></b><br><br>
		  <p> This tutorial simply combines the last computations into a sinlge function "Fock_to_P". We are already familiar with it by the 
		  <a href="../libcalculators/libcalculators_tut.html" target="_new">libcalculators tutorial</a>.		  
		  </p>
		  
		  <br><br>
		  <b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_hamiltonian_qm/test_qm3.py" target="_new">test_qm3.py</a></b><br><br>
		  <p> So far we have learned how to construct the core Hamiltonian (density-independent). However, the Fock Hamiltonian does depend on density.
		  In this tutorial, we will show how to compute the density-dependent Hamiltonian (Fock) matrix.
		  To make calculations more interesting, we have switched to a diatomic molecule (BH) rather than a single atom. You can, of course, choose from the
		  one of the commented options to load CO, C<sub>2</sub>, or CH<sub>4</sub> molecules.
		  </p>
		  <p>Well, first of all, we repeat all the calculations shown in the previous example. Next, we introduce a new data type - "Electronic_Structure".
		  It contains the essential information about the atomistic electronic structure calculations, including wavefunctions, orbital energies, density matrices,
		  and so on. One can learn more about the class from <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/hamiltonian/Hamiltonian_Atomistic/Hamiltonian_QM/Electronic_Structure.h" target="_new">Electronic_Structure.h</a>.
		  </p>
		  <p>In this tutorial, we demonstrate how to create an object of this type and how to set up some essential properties. This is all done with
		  
		  <pre class="brush: python;">el = Electronic_Structure(Norb)
el.set_Hao(Hao)
el.set_Sao(Sao)
el.set_P_alp(res_alp[2])
el.set_P_bet(res_bet[2])
		  </pre>
		  As we can see, the constructor used takes only one parameter as the argument - this is the number of orbitals (states). This information is used
		  to allocate memomry for all necessary marices and variables, and to initialize them, if possible. The internal representation of all matrices
		  included in the "Electronic_Structure" class used pointers to the "MATRIX" variables. Hence, to setup these variables, we use specially-designed
		  mamber-functions "set_Hao", "set_Sao", etc. The situation is similar with the one discussed in the "test_mm5.py" example of the 
		  <a href="../libhamiltonian_mm/libhamiltonian_mm_tut.html" target="_new">libhamiltonian_mm tutorial</a>.  
		  The "Electronic_Structure" data type is introduced to make the management of all variables involved in electronic structure calculations
		  simple and flexible.
		  </p>
		  <p>In the next stage, we use the "el" object of the "Electronic_Structure" type as an argument of our next function - "Hamiltonian_Fock_indo" or
		  "Hamiltonian_Fock_eht":
		  <pre class="brush: python;">if(prms.hamiltonian=="indo"):
    Hamiltonian_Fock_indo(el, syst, basis_ao, prms, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map)
elif(prms.hamiltonian=="eht"):
    Hamiltonian_Fock_eht(el, syst, basis_ao, prms, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map)
		  </pre>
		  These functions will compute the first guess of the Fock matrix. Why the first guess? Well, because the density matrix we use is only the first
		  guess density matrix (that corresponds to the core Hamiltonian). It is not yet self-consistent with the Fock matrix itself. This will be taken
		  care of in the following examples.
		  </p>
		  <p>The computed Fock matrices (one for alpha, one for beta channels) can be accessed via: "get_Fao_alp()" member-function:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">el.get_Fao_alp().show_matrix()</pre>
		  </p>
		  
		  
		  <br><br>
		  <b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_hamiltonian_qm/test_qm4.py" target="_new">test_qm4.py</a></b><br><br>
		  <p> All right, lets take care of self-consistency now. You can guess what I mean, right? Of course, it is self-consisten field (SCF) algorithm, which
		  we are ready to implement in this script.		  
		  </p>
		  <p> Well, the initial calculations follow the previous script completely. This way we obtain: core Hamiltonian, guess density, guess Fock matrix.
		  Since the convergence of the SCF calculations is judged on the basis of the electronic energy, we need to compute such energy for each iteration.
		  So we start by evaluating the energy for the guess density and guess Fock matrix:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">E = energy_elec(el.get_P_alp(), el.get_Hao(), el.get_Fao_alp()) + energy_elec(el.get_P_bet(), el.get_Hao(), el.get_Fao_bet())
print "Initial energy = ", E
		  </pre>
		  We have saved our current (initial guess) density matrices, in order to compute error in density on next iteration.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  Using the guess Fock matrices, we update electron density:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">res_alp = Fock_to_P(el.get_Fao_alp(), el.get_Sao(), Nelec_alp, degen, kT, etol, pop_opt)
res_bet = Fock_to_P(el.get_Fao_bet(), el.get_Sao(), Nelec_bet, degen, kT, etol, pop_opt)
	      </pre>
		  Note that the first argument of the function is the Fock matrix (in the first - guess - step, we used our core Hamiltonian as such initial Fock matrix).
		  The functions solve the eigenvalue problem using the update Fock matrices, and generate updated density matrices.		  
		  </p>
		  <p>On the next step, we update the variables of our "el" object to reflect updates of the density matrices:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">el.set_P_alp(res_alp[2])
el.set_P_bet(res_bet[2])
		  </pre>
		  and then, we use the update "el" object to compute new Fock matrix, similarly to how we did it in the first iteration.		  
		  </p>
		  <p>Using old density matrix and the one, updated in this iteration, we estimate the error in density as the sum of absolute values of 
		  the maximal elements of the difference matrices for alpha and beta channels:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">d_err = math.fabs((el.get_P_alp()-P_alp_old).max_elt()) + math.fabs((el.get_P_bet()-P_bet_old).max_elt())</pre>
		  and then we update the "old" matrices:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">P_alp_old = el.get_P_alp()
P_bet_old = el.get_P_bet()</pre>
		  </p>
		  <p>In a similar way, on every iteration we compute the electronic energy of the system and estimate error in energy.</p>
		  <p>Finally, we verify stopping criteria. We stop iterations when: a) we have done over i iterations (may or may not converge); 
          b) we have converged both in energy and density matrix - see the corresponding parameters that set these criteria.</p>
		  
		  <p> Running our calculations, we find that EHT calculations converge in no iterations (this is expected, because the standard EHT Hamiltonian
		  does not depend on density). The resulting output for BH molecule is:
		  <pre>Electronic energy =  -2.01844394621

		  When using the INDO Hamiltonian, it takes about 17 iterations to converge to energy convergence threshold of 1e-8 and density matrix

		  <b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_hamiltonian_qm/test_qm5.py" target="_new">test_qm5.py</a></b><br><br>
		  <p> One of the main ideas of the Libra package is its "methodology development" orientation. In the previous example we have constructed the 
		  iterative SCF scheme. Although it is pretty-much a standard tachniques, we have been able to access each of its steps, the and control everything
		  we wanted. Once this "methodology" is developed = working, debugged, and is ready for use, it can be made a single unit that can be used to 
		  construct methodologies of higher level of complexity. To do this, we translate our previous Python script into C++ and expose it back to Python
		  as a simple unit - the "scf" function. The function is defined in 
		  the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/hamiltonian/Hamiltonian_Atomistic/Hamiltonian_QM/SCF.h" target="_new">SCF.h</a> file
		  and subordinate files. Of course, in our case, our C++ implementation adds some advanced options - e.g. the choice of the convergence acceleration 
		  techniques, I/O to temporary binary files (to save on operative memory - this is especially important for computations involving large systems, when
		  matrices to store over 1000 states become notable in terms of memory consumption). 
		  </p>
		  <p>So, in this example we show how to use such function, instead of explicit steps discussed in the previous example:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">E = scf(el, syst, basis_ao, prms, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map, 0); </pre>
		  Note that the parameters controlling the "scf" function behaviour have been read into "prms" object from the the corresponding setup file.		 
		  </p>
		  <p>As one can see, the output of the "scf" function coincides with the output of the previous explicit calculations. Note that our control
		  file doesn't request any additional options that can be involved in SCF calculations (advanced convergence options). The advanced options will
		  be discussed in a separate tutorial. <!-- (5a - to do). -->

		  <p>Following the multi-level code hierarchy of Libra package, we have implemented a C++ analog of the long set of instructions in the previous
		  examples. Thus, all preparation steps that take care of initialization of parameters, pre-computations of some properties and setting control
		  parameters are now hidden inside the "init_qm_Hamiltonian" function. In analogy with creation of the MM Hamiltonian (see the corresponding
		  <a href="../libhamiltonian_mm/libhamiltonian_mm_tut.html" target="_new">tutorial</a>), we first initialize a generic atomistic Hamiltonian, but 
		  set its type to "QM" rather than "MM":
		  <pre class="brush: python;">ham = Hamiltonian_Atomistic(2, 3*syst.Number_of_atoms)
ham.set_Hamiltonian_type("QM")
		  </pre>
		  Note, however, that for QM calculations the dimensionality of the electronic sub-space (the number of electronic states) is now usually larger than
		  1 (as was in MM case). In this particular example, we request to create the Hamiltonian with 2 states. Another important piece of information - the
		  number of such states is not the number of electronic states (bands, orbitals) that will be computed inside the routines. It is the number of 
		  excited states we plan to incude in our dynamics calculations (e.g. in NA-MD). The default way Libra treats these excited states is based on consideration
		  of some excitonic effects. Namely, the excited states (as defined by input excitations) are defined as the ground-state Slater determinant with 
		  properly (according to the input excitations) modified occupation numbers. The orbitals remain to be those of the ground-state calculations, however
		  the energies of the states are treated as total (electronic + nuclear) energies of the states with different occupation numbers, without additional
		  optimization of orbitals. This is essentially the delta-SCF technique. The energy calculations, even without self-consistent iterations
		  may become quite expensive. If the number of excited states we want to consider is large, the computational costs scale accordingly. Thus, the dimensionality
		  of electronic sub-space of the created Hamiltonians should not be very large. This is often justified, because only a few low-lying excited
		  states are typically of the most interest. Note, however, that this dimensionality must agree with the number of input excitations (or at least to be
		  smaller than that), for the program to work. Alternatively, you'll see the error message and program will stop.
		  </p>
		  Similar to MM Hamiltonian, we bind the Hamiltonian with the object that contains the information about the atomistic system:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">ham.set_system(syst)</pre>
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  Like we said in the beginning, most of the essential instructions are hidden in the "init_qm_Hamiltonian" function:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">ham.init_qm_Hamiltonian("control_parameters_indo.dat")
#ham.init_qm_Hamiltonian("control_parameters_eht.dat")
		  </pre>
		  The function takes only one argument - the name of the file that contains all the control parameters, including the name of the
		  file that contains parameters for the selected Hamiltonian (model parameters). Thus, providing only the name of the control parameters file
		  is sufficient.
		  </p>
		  <p>Finally, for QM calculations, we must provide the definitions of the excited states we are interested in. This is done using the "add_excitation"
		  function:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">ham.add_excitation(0,1,1,1)
		  </pre>
		  As you can see, we add 1 excitations - this is more in agreement with the first parameter of the Hamiltonian_Atomistic constructor - "2". 
		  This is because the ground-state configuration is already present.
		  As we noted above, the total number 1 + number of excitations is in agreement with the dimensionality of the Hamiltonian.
		  The meaning of the parameters passed to the above "add_excitation" instructions is this:
		  <pre>add_excitation(from_orbital, from_spin, to_orbital, to_spin)
		  </pre>
		  Here, "from_orbital" - is the index of the orbital from which electron is promoted, starting with HOMO of the given system (HOMO is assumed to
		  have index 0), "to_orbital" - is the analogous number, but saying to which orbital the electron is moved. The indexing convention is the same.
		  "from_spin", "to_spin" - are the indices determining the sets of initial and final orbitals (1 - for alpha-channel, -1 - for beta-channel).
		  </p>
		  <p>The ground state is present by the default, no "ground-state excitations" are needed. In our example, the excitation that is added 
		  promotes alpha-electron from HOMO to the alpha-LUMO orbital.
		  </p>
		  <p>Once the calculations are done with the "compute()" function, the elements of the electronic Hamiltonian (adiabatic representation) can be
		  accessed via general functions of the "Hamiltonian" class:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">print "Energy = ", ham.H(i,i), " a.u."</pre>
		  </p>

		  <p> This tutorial first resorts to the explicit construction of core and Fock Hamiltonians and all related variables. Once the self-consistent
		  solution is found, the derivatives of core and Fock matrices w.r.t to coordinates of each of the two atoms (here we consider a diatomic
		  molecule) are computed. So far, the derivatives of the Hamiltonians are shown for the INDO method, those for the EHT are currently being implemented.
		  </p>
		  <p>The instructions to compute derivatives of the matrices are:
		  <pre class="brush: python;">Hamiltonian_core_deriv_indo(syst, basis_ao, prms, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map, Hao, Sao, DF, c, dHao_dx, dHao_dy, dHao_dz, dSao_dx, dSao_dy, dSao_dz )

Hamiltonian_Fock_derivs_indo(el, syst, basis_ao, prms, modprms, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map, c, dHao_dx, dHao_dy, dHao_dz, dFao_alp_dx, dFao_alp_dy, dFao_alp_dz, dFao_bet_dx, dFao_bet_dy, dFao_bet_dz)

update_derivative_coupling_matrix(x_period, y_period, z_period, t1, t2, t3, atom_to_ao_map, ao_to_atom_map, basis_ao, c, Dao_x, Dao_y, Dao_z);
		  </pre>
		  The first function returns derivatives of the core Hamiltonian and overlap matrices into the objdects dHao_dx, ... dSao_dz passed as references.
		  The second function uses these matrices (to save on computaions) and returns the derivatives of the Fock matrix via the objects dFao_alp_dx,... dFao_bet_dz.
		  The third function computes the derivative coupling matrices &ltAO(i)|d/dR_c|AO(j)&gt in the AO basis - to store in the Dao_x, ... Dao_z matrices.
		  In all functions, we use a parameter "c", which has the meaning of the index of the nuclus with respect to whose position we take all the above deri
		  vatives.
		  </p>
		  <p>
		  What is important to note in the output is that the derivatives of the core and Fock matrices with respect to atom 0 are opposite to the derivatives
		  w.r.t. to atom 1, for instance:

		   The same symmetry holds for derivatives of the overlap matrix. 
		  </p>
		  <p> Another important observation is that the derivative coupling matrices, Dao_x, ... do not have any special symmetry properties: 
		  the matrices are neither symmetric by themselves, nor they are symmetric/anti-symmetric/opposite with respect to the derivative couplings
		  computed for the different atom. For instance, for the x component we have:

		  for the 2-nd one.		 
		  </p>
		  <p>Although there are no special symmetries on the derivative couplings, there is still one property which one should be aware of.
		  Namely, the sum of the derivative coupling matrix and its transpose are equal to the derivative of the overlap matrix w.r.t. to given 
		  coordinate: D_ij + D_ji = dSao/dR = &ltAO(i)|d/dR_c AO(j)&gt + &ltd/dR_c AO(i)| AO(j)&gt = d/dR_c &ltAO(i) | AO(j)&gt.
