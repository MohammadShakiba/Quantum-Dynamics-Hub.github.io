          <h3>Libcontext Tutorials</h3><br>
		  
		  <br><br>
		<b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_context/test_context.py" target="_new">test_context.py</a></b><br><br>
		<p>The context library is developed to work with the arbitrary data structures - ideally of arbitrary format and complexity. The second main point
		is that the objects representing these data structures would be accessible from C++ and Python. This can eventually be convenient for flexible customization
		of some internally-implemented algorithms: e.g. passing some development flags and parameters to the implementation side. But enough words, lets see
		how this works.
		</p>
		<p>
		First, lets create a Context object:
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx = Context()</pre>
		The object doesn't contain much so far. Essentially it is a wrap around the Boost.Property_tree Property_tree template class, the instance of which
		is hidden as the "ctx_pt" private variable. But this is not the only data we have. The class also stores the relative "path" where we are in this
		property tree. This is stored in the "path" variable (also private).
		</p>
		<p>To retrieve the "path" variable, we use the method "get_path":
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx.get_path()</pre>
		which is set to "glob_context" by default.
		</p>
		<p>Perhaps one of the most convenient used of the "Context" class can be storing the content of variables of such type as XML files.
		This can be done via:
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx.save_xml("ctx_1.xml")</pre>
		In our present example, this will print an "empty" XML file containing only the header
		<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?></xmp>
		</p>
		<p> An alternative way to create a variable of "Context" type (and initialize it) is to call one of the overloaded constructors.
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx = Context("ctx_example.xml")</pre>
		The argument is the name of an XML file that we want to turn into the variable of "Context" type. Our tutorial comes together with a predefined
		file "ctx_example.xml" shown below:
		</p>
		<br>
		<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<control_params>
    <runtype>nscf</runtype>
    <hamiltonian>eht</hamiltonian>
    <spin_method>unrestricted</spin_method>
    <DF>0</DF>
    <guess_type>sad</guess_type>
    <nac_min_orbs>
        <0>1</0>
        <1>2</1>
        <2>3</2>
    </nac_min_orbs>
    <x>
        <param1>1</param1>
        <param2>Chalk</param2>
        <param3>
            <0>0</0>
            <1>1</1>
            <2>2</2>
        </param3>
    </x>
</control_params>
</xmp>
		<p>Returning the value of "path" variable as before (with "get_path" method), will give us "control_params". That is the path is set to the 
		outermost tag of the read XML file. 
		</p>
		<p>To show that the created structure is not empty as before, we can print it into another file, say "ctx_2.xml". You can see that the newly 
		created "ctx_2.xml" file contains same fields and data as the original file "ctx_example.xml". The only difference is that some extra blank lines
		are inserted. I don't know why is this so - perhaps something related to property_tree formatting. Anyway, it is not critical.
		</p>
		
		<p>Now lets see how to change the path names. To do this we use the "set_path" member function. In the script below:
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx = Context("ctx_example.xml")
ctx.set_path("new_control_params")
ctx.save_xml("ctx_2a.xml")
		</pre>
		We read the existing XML file, which sets the path of the "ctx" object to the "control_params" value. We then change the current path to the new
		value "new_control_params", and then print the object back to the new file "ctx_2a.xml". Looking into the output, you will notice that the 
		"ctx_2.xml" file is essentially the original file (with extra blank lines), but with the uppermost level tag being redefined to be "new_control_params".
		</p>
		<p>Now, lets see how we can manually edit the XML tree stored in the object of "Context" class. Well, editing here mostly implies adding new
		properties or changing the existing ones, not so much of deleting the nodes. The adding of new properties with simple data types is demonstrated in
		the following script:
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx = Context()
ctx.set_path("new_path")
param1 = 1.0
ctx.add("param1", param1)
param2 = "Chalk"
ctx.add("param2", param2)		
		</pre>
		Here, we first change the name of the outermost tag (the "path" variable) from its default value to the customized one. We then create new variables
		and assign the variables of appropriate type to their values. Here we demonstrate the creation of variable the "param1" of integer type, storing the
		value of 1.0, and the creation of the variable "param2" of string type, storing the value of "Chalk". 
		</p>
		<p><b>Important design/philosophy notes</b>
		Now, why do I refer to these tags as variables?
		Well, because one can imagine a class of some type with couple of internal variables - "param1" and "param2" defined in it. One would them be able to
		use those variables via some methods or directly. The variables would be accessible both in C++ implementation, but would need to be exported to Python.
		The problem with such implementation would be that in different context we would need different sets of variables, so we would need to define 
		multiple classes storing context-specific information. This is a lot of work to implement and maintain those classes, to export them to Python, and
		to setup the C++/Python/file input/output data flows. As a generic alternative, we created the "Context" class, which may contain arbitrary collection
		of data-fields. The data flow between C++/Python sides and file is easy and straightforward. One might actually think of using something like
		"map" of "maps" or "list" or "list" data structures, but one wouls still need to define the interface between Python and C++ implementation. Moreover,
		there would be no XML write/read support. With the "Context" data type these operations are inherited from the Boost.Property_tree template. 
		One more advantage of this data representation is that the variables and the variable names are detached as much as possible: imagine you have defined
		a class and have used it in many other places to implement a lot of other functionality. But, at some point you have realized you wanted to change
		some variable name to a "better" one. What then - change all the code that you have created? With the "Context" data type, you can change variable
		name relatively easy - just add another one, or redefine the meaning of the old one.
		</p>
		<p>Alright, so we have added couple of variables (in XML language, we would call them data fields or tags) of different simple types. How would we call
		them back? What if the user is unsure what the name of the variable is? These questions are taken care of in the member-function "get". Consider the
		examples:
		<pre class="brush: python;">print ctx.get("param1", -1) 
print ctx.get("param1a", -1) 
print ctx.get("param2", "Milk") 
print ctx.get("param2a", "Milk") 
		</pre>
		Here, we access the content of a given variable by calling the common "get" function with the name of the variable we want to access. We also supply
		the function with the default result - it is returned in case when no variable with provided name have been found in the data tree. In our case,
		since the variables "param1" is already defined, the returned value will be 1, which we set in the earlier steps. However, because the variable 
		"param1a" has not been defined yet, when trying to access it and return its value, only the default value provided in the "get" function will be 
		returned. In this case it is -1. The same situation with the value "Chalk" defined in the variable "param2" and the default value "Milk", defined
		as the default returned value, if the variable "param2" is not found.
		</p>
		<p>Further, we can add the data of more complex type. Specifically, we show how a list of integers can be added. On the C++ side, the data type 
		"intList" is defined, which is essentially "vector<int>". The list with 3 elements is created using the following instructions:
		<pre class="brush: python;">param3 = intList()
for i in xrange(3):
    param3.append(i)		
		</pre>
		The final list can then be added to the object of "Context" type with the "add" function we used with simple data types. Before we retrieve the
		created data variables, we define another intList object with only one element (containing -1), as the default return value. The resulting object
		is now written into the "ctx_3.xml" file:
		</p>		
		<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<new_path>
    <param1>1</param1>
    <param2>Chalk</param2>
    <param3>
        <0>0</0>
        <1>1</1>
        <2>2</2>
    </param3>
</new_path>

		</xmp>
		<p>Points to notice: a) the name of the uppermost tag is the one we set in the beginning of the procedure; b) the way the arrays are printed out -
		each element comes with the tag which is derived from the index of that element.</p>
		<p>We are now in position to cover even more interesting operation on the objects of the "Context" class. Namely, we are going to show 2 more 
		features of "add" function:
		<ul>
			<li>"add" called with the variable which is already defined - simply overwrites the old value of that variable. This is demonstrated on this
		script: <pre class="brush: python;">p1 = 2.0
ctx.add("param1", p1)
ctx.save_xml("ctx_4a.xml")</pre>
		Here, we try to add another "param1" variable to the "ctx" variable. But because it is already defined (with value of 1), we don't actually create 
		yet another tag (with the same name as the one already existing), but we rather replace the old value (1.0) with the new one (2.0). The eventual 
		result is printed in the "ctx_4a.xml" file, which is essentially the same as "ctx_3.xml", but with the value of the "param1" variable equal to 2.0.
			</li>
			<li>"add" can be used to combine two objects of the "Context" type - to create complex, many-level structures. Here we add one object, "ctx1",
			derived from the earlier generated "ctx_3.xml" file with the latter's top tag renamed to "old_path". The object "ctx1" is added as a branch
			of another earlier-derived object "ctx". The final "ctx" object is printed into file "ctx_4b.xml". The corresponding code is:
			<pre class="brush: python;">ctx.add(ctx1) 
ctx.save_xml("ctx_4b.xml")
			</pre>
			The output is:
			<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<new_path>
    <param1>2</param1>
    <param2>Chalk</param2>
    <param3>
        <0>0</0>
        <1>1</1>
        <2>2</2>
    </param3>
    <old_path>
        
    
    
    

        <param1>1</param1>
        <param2>Chalk</param2>
        <param3>
            
        
        
        
    
            <0>0</0>
            <1>1</1>
            <2>2</2>
        </param3>
    </old_path>
</new_path>

			</xmp>
			Where you can see how one XML is nested into the other one.
			</li>
		</ul>	
		</p>
		<p>Finally, one can extract one XML from the other (more complex). Or, equivalently, one can extract sub-object of the "Context" type from the
		complex object of that type. This capability is very convenient for accessing specific portion of complex data withough much of efforts as would
		be necessary in the element-wise access modes. The extraction is done via yet another version of the "get" function, as demonstrated by
		the script below:
		<pre class="brush: python;">ctx2 = ctx.get("old_path", ctx)
print "path=", ctx2.get_path()
ctx2.save_xml("ctx_5.xml") 
		</pre>
		Here, the "ctx" passed as the second argument comes as the default return variable - in case the sub-tree with the outer-level tag "old_path" would
		not be found. Fortunately, it is present in our case, making the "get()" function to return the sub-tree with the outermost level being "old_path".
		The resulting "Context" variable is printed out to "ctx_5.xml", so the result can be visualized:
		<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<old_path>
    <param1>1</param1>
    <param2>Chalk</param2>
    <param3>
        
        
        
        
    
        <0>0</0>
        <1>1</1>
        <2>2</2>
    </param3>
</old_path>

		</xmp>
		In case we want to extract an even deeper level of objects, we need to use "." separator in the names of the variables. For instance, one would need
		to use "old_path.param3" to access the intList variable "param3":
		<xmp><?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<old_path>
    <param3>
        <0>0</0>
        <1>1</1>
        <2>2</2>
    </param3>
</old_path>

		</xmp>
		</p>

		<b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_context/test_control_parameters.py" target="_new">test_control_parameters.py</a></b><br><br>
		<p>This script simply loads the parameters controlling some simulations (not really affecting any simulations yet, just showing). We use the example
		XML input file that specifies all the parameters for such hypothetical simulations. This is only to show how one can easily define simulation 
		protocols using an XML format and loading those protocols into the code. Since the data members of the "Context" class can be accessed via low-level
		C++ implementations, this feature provides a convenient mechanism for providing input to arbitrary simulations. Note: presently we still use some of
		the older specific classes that store the parameters of simulations. Eventually, the goal will be to switch to the new scheme, which is sketched in
		the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/src/context/ctx_Control_Parameters.cpp" target="_new">"ctx_Control_Parameters.cpp"
		</a> file. Consider the following code:
		<pre class="brush: cpp;">// <calculations>
  std::string hamiltonian = "eht";          add("calculations.hamiltonian", hamiltonian);
  std::string spin_method = "unrestricted"; add("calculations.spin_method", spin_method);
  int DF = 0;                               add("calculations.DF", DF);
  // </calculations>

  // <guess_options>
  std::string guess_type = "sad";           add("guess_options.guess_type", guess_type);
  // </guess_options>

  // <scf_options>
  std::string scf_algo = "oda";             add("scf_options.scf_algo", scf_algo);
  int use_disk = 0;                         add("scf_options.use_disk", use_disk);
  int use_rosh = 0;                         add("scf_options.use_rosh", use_rosh);
		</pre>
		Here, the column to the left shows how the variables of the class can be initialized in the default constructor. Obviously, the variables would
		need to be declared in the heated file. On the contrary, the column to the right shows how the variables can be defined and initialized in the
		new way, using the XML-type schema. The possibility for sctructuring options into logical blocks is also shown - just use the "." separator. 
		For instance, the subsections of the "calculations" tag (section) are defined as "calculations.hamiltonian", "calculation.spin_method", etc. For 
		farther level of structuring, use more dots. 		
		</p>
		<p>Also note that "add" function is called as is, within the construction (not via "." directive). This is because the "ctx_Control_Parameters"
		class is the derivative class of the base "Context" class. Also, think of this possibility - since we don't need to declare variables - the variables
		of the class are actually added at the point of object creation (in the constructor), and can eventually be added as necessary. This enables great
		degree of flexibility in working with the code.
		</p>

		<b><a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/libracode/code/ci/master/tree/tests/test_qe/test_1_no_soc/test_context.py" target="_new">Reading spin-polarized QE wavefunction, no SOC</a></b><br><br>
		<p>Now, lets discuss more practical application of the <a>Context</a> class. Specifically, with its help we can conveniently and compactly read the
		XML files generated by QE programs (pw.x and pw_export.x). Also, note that the files for this and several following tutorials are in the 
		"tests/test_qe" folder, not in "tests/test_context" as before. </p>
		<p>To start this tutorial, we'll need to run some QE calculations first. This is done by running the simple Shell script:
		<pre>sh ./run.sh</pre>
		Of course, you'd first need to edit the script to indicate the paths of the pw.x and pw_export.x executable of the QE distribution. Since this 
		is a mere example, we set the kinetic energy cutoff defining plane wave basis to a ridiculously small value of 2 Ry. This value of course
		doesn't have any physical meaning (that is it leads to non-physical = very poor wavefunctions), but helps accelerating the calculations, so
		the tutorial can be run in seconds. We also use a very small ethylene molecule, so the calculations are very fast. Therefore, we don't even need to
		use any sort of job managers (SLURM/PBS) and can simply run the calculations in the command line (terminal), also on personal computers and laptops.		
		</p>
		<p>Now, when the first step is completed, our folder will contain a lot of additional files and directories, namely: 
		<pre> x.scf.out  x.exp.out  x.wfc  x.paw  x.export  x.save</pre>		
		</p>
		<p>The ".out" files will contain the output of the corresponding calculations. The "x.wfc" file is a binary file containing the wavefunction.
		This file is ustilized by the "pw_export.x" program to generate the "x.export" file containing all the details of the calculations in a human-readable
		format. Specifically, we will need the files "x.wfc1" and "x.wfc2". These files contain the plane-wave representation of thealpha and beta orbitals.
		These are the main files for us to read, at least for the present purpose. Luckily, when the "pw_export.x" converts the "x.wfc" file into a human-readable
		format, it also uses an XML formatting. This allows us to utilize the "Context" data type to read all the data. 
		</p>
		<p>The main Python file for this tutorial is "test_context.py". It contains an already predefined function that reads the generated XML files.
		We first create a Context object from a given data file (either "x.export/x.wfc1" or "x.export/x.wfc2", as reminded by the comment, vide infra):
		<pre>ctx = Context(filename)  #("x.export/wfc.1")</pre>
		Because the file names are composed utilizing the dots ("."), the access to the childrens of the XML is problematic ("." is also a default level 
		separator). To avoid this complication, we setup the path separator to be a forward slash "/": 
		<pre>ctx.set_path_separator("/")</pre>
		Now, we can access the data in this XML file. But where are we? The highest level XML tag for the "x.wfc1" file is "Kpoint.1". This info returned
		by the "get_path()" function:
		<pre>ctx.get_path()</pre>
		The children of the present branch are: "Info", "Wfc.1", "Wfc.2", ... , "Wfc.10". This is shown by the "show_children" function:
		<pre>ctx.show_children(upper_tag)</pre>		
		Before we start reading the actual wavefunction, it helps to determine the number of the wavefunctions to read and their size (how many planewaves
		is used in the corresponding expansions). Luckily, this information is printed out withing the &lt Info &gt tag as the attributes "nbnd" and "ngw",
		respectively. However, there is a little complication: these are the attributes rather than the children of the given parent. The access to these
		data elements is possible via the "xmplattr" specifier within the "get" function:
		<pre>ngw = int(float(ctx.get("Info/&ltxmlattr&gt/ngw","n")))
nbnd = int(float(ctx.get("Info/&ltxmlattr&gt/nbnd","n")))</pre>
		Once the parameters are read out, we can allocate memory for the wavefunctions we are going to read. The coefficients are the complex-valued
		numbers. That is why we create an object of the CMATRIX type:
		<pre>coeff = CMATRIX(ngw,nbnd)</pre>
		</p>
		<p>All right, it is time to actually read the data. So we iterate over all molecular orbitals. For each one we use the "get" function to
		access a big string with the coefficients for given MO:
		<pre>all_coeff = ctx.get("Wfc."+str(band), "n").split(',')</pre>
		However, the resulting variable "all_coeff" must be split and converted into a numerical vaules. This is done with the Python's "split" funciton.
		Note that we use it twice - with comma and whitespace being delimiters. That is because of the particular format of the data file. 
		Eventually, the extracted real and imaginary components of the wavefunctions are placed into the appropriate positions of the coeff matrix.
		</p>
		<p>Having reviewed the basic workflow of the "read_qe_wfc" function, we can now focus on the data extracted from the wavefunction files.
		At the upper level of the script, we read the wavefunctions from the two created files:
		<pre>coeff_1 = read_qe_wfc("x.export/wfc.1", "Kpoint.1")
coeff_2 = read_qe_wfc("x.export/wfc.2", "Kpoint.2")</pre>
        "coeff_1" then contains the wavefunction coefficients for the alpha spin orbitals, whereas "coeff_2" - the coefficients for the beta spin orbitals:
		`psi_(alpha,i)(r) = sum_(vec G) coeff1_(vec G, i) * exp(-i*vec r* vec G)` and 
		`psi_(beta,i)(r) = sum_(vec G) coeff2_(vec G, i) * exp(-i*vec r* vec G)`, where `vec G` is grid point corresponding to given coefficient
		`coeff(1//2)_(vec G, i)`, and `i` is the MO index.
		In a sense, these coefficients only define the spatial components of the wavefunction, but the orthogonality of the different spin compnents is
		included implicitly. At the same time, the orthogonality of the same-sping components originates solely from the spatial components of the wavefunctions.
		</p>		
		<p>So, we are to veryfy the orthogonaity of the read-out wavefunction. For that we use the matrices of the coefficients to compute the MO overlap 
		matrices. It can be shown that, if the matrices of the read out coefficients are denoted by `CC_sigma`, then the overlap matrices will be computed as:

ovlp_12 = coeff_1.H() * coeff_2</pre>

		<p>Now, lets consider what happens in the so-called non-collinear magnetism case. That is when the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has been turned on in QE calculations.
		Practically, the calculations with the SOC are turned on in QE by adding the following lines:</p>
		<pre>noncolin = .true.,
lspinorb = .true.
</pre>
        <p>Well, it is the first line that includes SOC. But the second one is important because it uses the relativistic contributions of the pseudopotentials.
		Naturally, the pseudopotential must be fully-relativistic, so be careful which pseudopotential you choose.</p>
		<p>It worth mentioning yet another important difference between the calculations with SOC vs. those without. In the former case, all orbitals
		can only be sinlgy-occupied, so they do not come in pairs, really. For our case of ethylene, there are 12 electrons. Thus, we must have at least
		12 orbitals ("nbnd" keyword). For instance, in the no-SOC case, we used nbnd = 10, meaning there were 10 pairs of orbitals (degenerate in the
		restricted "nbnd = 1" case, and non-necessarily degenerate in the unrestricted "nbnd = 2" case). Therefore, there were 2 x 10 = 20 boxes to place 12
		electrons in. In the SOC case, what we put as "nbnd" parameter becomes this "total number of boxes". So, 10 wouldn't work for 12 electrons. 
		Thus, we have to specify a bigger number. To be consistent with the previous calculations, we set it to 20. 
		</p>Unlike the no-SOC case, the "x.export" folder contains only a single "x.wfc1" file, but it contains all 20 mixed-spin spin-orbitals. Thus,
		we read only a single set of coefficients:
		<pre>coeff_1 = read_qe_wfc("x.export/wfc.1", "Kpoint.1")</pre> 
		and eventually generate only a single overlap 20 x 20 matrix `CC^+ * CC`.
		<p>
		<p>The obtained overlap matrix has many non-zero off-diagonal elements. Even more, if we look at the overlaps of the all spin-orbitals with themselves:
		`&ltphi_i|phi_i&gt`, we will realize that these orbitals are not even close to being normalized:
		<pre>for n in xrange(nbnd):
    print n, ovlp_1.get(n,n)
</pre>
yields:

		</p>
		<p>This is because, the actual wavefunctions are now the two-component spinors: `psi_n = ((phi_(2n)), (phi_(2n+1)))`. So, in a sense, we still have
		pairs of orbitals, but now these are not the pure alpha and beta orbitals, but rather the components of the mixed spin-orbital onto the 
		alpha and beta spin-projections, respectively. The scalar product of the two 2-component spinors is naturally redefined as:
		`&ltpsi_i | psi_j&gt = (phi_(2n)^(**), phi_(2n+1)^(**)) * ((phi_(2k)), (phi_(2k+1))) = &ltphi_(2n) | phi_(2k)&gt + &ltphi_(2n+1) | phi_(2k+1)&gt`
		</p>
		<p>Therefore, the overlaps of the spinor functions with themselves would be computed as:
		<pre>for n in xrange(nbnd/2):
    print n, ovlp_1.get(2*n,2*n) + ovlp_1.get(2*n+1,2*n+1)
</pre>
        yielding what we expect:
		<pre>0 (1.05104106405+0j)

8 (1.00076053025+0j)
9 (1.00140632332+0j)
</pre>
        Analogously, the overlap of the spinor functions is close to the unity matrix with the off-diagonal elements being close to zero. Sometimes, non-zeores
		are observed, which is a shortcoming of using initially non-orthogonalized components of the spin functions (due to pseudopotential).

        indicating that the MOs within the same k-point bundle are orthogonal, but that they are not across the k-points. In fact, if the multiple
		k-points calculations are performed self-consistently, the MOs are orthogonal also across different k-points. The reason we don't obtain
		real unities, is due to more compicated procedure to compute the MO overlaps - the formula would go beyond the simple `CC^+ * CC`. There 
		will be additional couplings due to different k-points (in a sense, these are the counterparts of the AO overlaps when the MOs are represented
		in a localized AO basis). The computation of the "overlaps" is a bit complicated, and will be discussed in the future versions of this tutorial.
