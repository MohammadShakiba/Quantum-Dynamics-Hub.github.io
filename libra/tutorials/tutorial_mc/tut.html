      <h3>Lattice Monte Carlo Tutorial</h3><br>
      <p>
        This tutorial shows how to utilize the Metropolis algorithm for Monte Carlo (MC) search of a minimal energy structure. In 
        particutlar, we will consider 1D, 2D, and 3D cubic lattices composed of species of a given type. We then consider a certain
        percentage of doping of the lattice with species of another type. We then define the effective interaction Hamiltonian
        (lattice Hamiltonian) that relies on local coordination of each atom (site) of the lattice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is easy to realize that there are combinatorially-many configurations one could have. Thus, there is a multitude of
        configurations with local minium of energy, separated by high potential energy barrier. Direct optimization or even the MD-based
        sampling for minimal energy configurations (e.g. via annealing) would be computationally expensive and is not guaranteed to convergence
        to a minimal energy structure. Thus, the MC-based search for the minimal energy structure is the most optimal strategy, since it
        both has a potential of converging to the "global" minimum and may be made computationally inexpensive.

      <br><br>
      <h2>Script workflow overview</h2>
      <p>
        Lets look at the "model.py" script and explain the steps it is doing
      </p>
      <p>
        First, we read a file containing the unit cell composition. The file is in the .xyz format. 
        The assumption is the the coordinates are in Angstrom, but when we read it, they are converted to 
        atomic units (Bohr) by the script. Notice that we use the "build" module of the "libra_py" module.
      </p>

<code><pre>
L0, R0 = build.read_xyz(prefix+".xyz")
</pre></code>

      <p>
        Next, we define the lattice translation vectors and the number of translations in each direction
        and then create a supercell of a desired size. Vary the combination of Nx, Ny, and Nz to construct
        1D, 2D, or 3D lattice. The example below shows how to construct a 2D lattice.
      </p>

<code><pre>
Nx, Ny, Nz = 30, 30, 1
a = VECTOR(1.0,   0.0,   0.0) * Angst # convert to a.u.
b = VECTOR(0.0,   1.0,   0.0) * Angst # convert to a.u.
c = VECTOR(0.0,   0.0,   1.0) * Angst # convert to a.u.
L1, R1 = build.generate_replicas_xyz2(L0, R0, a, b, c, Nx, Ny, Nz)
</pre></code>

      <p>
        We define auxiliary variables - e.g. the masses and the maximal coordination number for all atoms.
        The masses are irrelevant for these calculations, so we set them just to 1.0. The MaxCoord variable is 
        more important, because it will determine to how many nearby atoms (withing a specified radius) each 
        atom of the lattice can be connected. The determined connectivities will later affect the calculations of 
        the lattice energy. Note that the atoms (or rather the lattice sites) can be connected to fewer other sites,
        if there are not enough of them withing the bonding distance.
      </p>		  

<code><pre>
masses = []
MaxCoord = []
for i in xrange(len(L1)):
    masses.append(1.0)
    MaxCoord.append(6)
</pre></code>

      <p>
        We are now ready to define the connectivities among the lattice sites. This is done with the help of the 
        "autoconnect_pbc" function of the "autoconnect" module of the "libra_py" module. The autoconnect_pbc function
        takes as the arguments: 1) the positions of all sites (R1); 2) the maximal coordination number of each site (MaxCoord);
        3) the bonding dinstance (Rcut) - if two lattice sites are separated less than this distance, they will be declared connected
        unless the maximal coordination number of any of the two sites is reached. In the latter situation, only the closest sites 
        within the Rcut radius will be connected; 4) the translation vectors of the supercell (tv1, tv2, tv3) and the option for handling
        periodic connectivities (pbc_opt). These parameters are needed if we want to treat the lattice as periodic in any of the direction
        or in any combination of the periodic directions. In paricular, if one sets <var>pbc_opt</var> to "a", then the lattice will be treated 
        as periodic in 1 dimension (a direction defined by the vector tv1). In that case, two lattice sites may be separated by more than
        Rcut, whereas if one of the sites is translated by tv1 (or -tv1), the translated site may end up being withing the Rcut radius from
        the other one. In this case, the two sites may be declared connected.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can impose the peridicity in any of the 3 directions, by setting pbc_opt to either "a", "b", or "c".
        If you want to create a 2D lattice, you have 3 options for <var>pbc_opt</var> variable: "ab", "ac", or "bc"
        If you treat the system as periodic in 3D, use <code>pbc_opt = "abc"</code>.
        Finally, if you don't want impose any periodicity, use <code>pbc_opt = "none"</code>
      </p>
      <p>
        The autoconnect_pbc function will generate a connectivity list (connect). Each element of this list represent
        the connectivity of each atom of the lattice. It is composed of the 2 elements: the index of the considered lattice atom 
        and the list of the indiced of the lattice atoms connected to the present one. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This procedure may be computationally quite demanding, especially for large lattices, but it needs to be executed only onces, since
        the connectivities in the lattice are assumed to be presented during the optimization algorithm execution. Note, however, that 
        we are talking about the connectivities of the lattice sites, whereas the sites can be occupied by different atom types.
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
# Compute the connectivities   
Rcut = 1.1 * Angst
tv1 = a * Nx
tv2 = b * Ny
tv3 = c * Ny
pbc_opt = "a"
connect, line, unsorted_pairs_out = autoconnect.autoconnect_pbc(R1, MaxCoord, Rcut, tv1, tv2, tv3, pbc_opt)
</pre></code>

      <p>
        For the purposes of producing the snapshots of different geometries, we create a chemical system (System)
        object <var>syst</var> and populate it with the atoms of the created super-cell (lattice). This is where we need the 
        masses variable defined above - but this is more of a dummy variable, to comply with the function signature. 		  
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
syst = System()
build.add_atoms_to_system(syst, L1, R1, VECTOR(1.0, 1.0, 1.0), masses, "elements.dat")
</pre></code>

      <p>
        We are now ready to setup variable that will control our simulation:
        <ol>
          <li>
            <var>nsnaps</var> - how many configuration snapshots we want to produce (for visualizing);
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>nsteps</var> - how many MC move we are going to perform between each output;
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>kT</var> - an effective temperature of simulation. Setting a larger temperature may help accelerate the
             convergence, but at the same time it may allow higher fraction of the accepted higher-energy configurations.
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>fract</var> - a fraction of the lattice sites to be substituted by a dopant;
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>dopant_indx</var> - the index of the lattice species that corresponds to the dopant atoms;
          </li>
          <li>
            <var>n_move_at</var> - how many pairs of lattice sites we are going to swap at every MC (attempted) move.
            When swapping, we ensure to only exchange the lattice atom identities between the sites occupied by different
            types of species. Setting this value to large number may help accelerate the convergence in the beginning of
            the run, but is not good for final optimization. Setting it to 1 will ensure the steady convergence, although 
            it may be slowed sometimes.
          </li> 
          <li>
            <var>mapping</var> - we associate each type of lattice species with a chemical element. This is needed only
            for printing out the molecular structure files, and does not affect the calculations themselves;
          </li> 
          <li>
            <var>H1</var> and <var>H2</var> - these are, perhaps, the most important inputs for each lattice model. 
            They determine the energetics of the lattice. The i-th diagonal elements of H1 define the energy of occupying
            a lattice site with the species of type i. The i-j element of the matrix H2 defines the interaction energy 
            between the connected sites occupied by species of types i and j. The present example aims to produce energy
            gain when the species of the type 1 (Br) are next to each other. This parameter should favor clustering of the 
            species of type 1. 
          </li>
        </ol>
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
nsnaps = 100
nsteps = 500
kT = 0.01    
fract = 0.2
dopant_indx = 1
n_move_at = 1
mapping = ["Ar", "Br"]

H1 = MATRIX(2,2)
H1.set(0,0, 0.0)
H1.set(1,1, 0.0)
    
H2 = MATRIX(2,2)
H2.set(0,0,  0.00);  H2.set(0,1, -0.05)
H2.set(1,0, -0.05);  H2.set(1,1, -0.20)
</pre></code>

      <p>
        We now create the lattice for simulations. In principle,one won't need to create a chemical system object
        to do this as well as one won't need many of the previous steps. Yet, the previous steps were needed to define
        the connectivities and for printing out the configurations. The "make_doped" function creates a lattice doped with
        the species of a certain type to a specified doping level. The resulting <var>sites</var> variable is a list of integers 
        corresponding to the type if the species occupying each of the lattice sites.
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
# Create the dopped lattice
sites = make_doped(nat, fract, 0, dopant_indx)  
</pre></code>

      <p>
        The following functions compute the energy of a lattice for the sites occupied according to the variable <var>sites</var>,
        as well as doing the MC move (whether successful or not) to evolve the lattice sites occupations.
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
en = energy(connect, sites, H1, H2) 
sites, en = mc_move(connect, sites, dopant_indx, n_move_at, H1, H2, en, kT, rnd)
</pre></code>

      <p>
        In the actual MC calculations we only operate with integers (representation for the lattice site occupations).
        This makes the calculations more efficient (e.g. as opposed to dealing with strings), general (1,2,3 could represent
        any abstract entity), and conveninent (we can access the matrix elements of the lattice Hamiltonians H1 and H2).
        However, when it comes to printing out the configurations, we need to convert the integers to something more chemically-
        relevant, like element names. This is conveniently done using the variable <var>mapping</var> we have defined above.
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
syst.Atoms[i].Atom_element = mapping[ sites[i] ]
</pre></code>

      <p>
        Finally, onece we have updates the syst object, we can print out it to the files. The function "print_ent"
        allows printing files in the PDB format recognized by the VMD software. In this example, we assume we have a folder
        named "mc_run" created. This is where all the files will be printed out. In our other examples, we will change this 
        variable accordingly. 
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">syst.print_ent("2D/step%i" % snap)</pre></code>


      <br><br>

      <h2>Overview of the Tcl script</h2>
      <p>
        We iterate over a given number of files. Change if different. In this case, it is 100 
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">for {set i 0} { $i < 100 } {incr i } {  </pre></code>

      <p>
        We load the file step$i into a molecule. It is expected that te file is of PDB format. We then
        set obtain the index of the molecule we have just created (automatically the top one). This is needed for
        further access to the molecule and manipulating it.
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
mol load pdb step$i
set indx [ molinfo top ]
</pre></code>

      <p>
        For the presently loaded molecule we create a representation and change it to "cpk" style, so that
        our lattice looks nice when rendering is done. 
      </p>
      
<code><pre class="brush: python;">
mol addrep $indx
mol modstyle 1 $indx cpk
</pre></code>

      <p>
        Render the molecule to create a picture
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">render snapshot pic$i.png</pre></code>

      <p>
        Delete representation and the molecule.
      </p>

<code><pre class="brush: python;">
mol delrep 1 $indx
mol delete $indx
</pre></code>
