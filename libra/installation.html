      <h3>General installation instructions</h3>
      <p>
        These instructions are developed on my (AVA) system and may not work in all other cases, but the hope is 
        that they will stay valid most of the time (provided one can suitably customize them). These instructions are now
        working on the WSL, but can be ported to other systems, like Linux.
      </p>
      <ol>

        <li>Get a miniconda installer and install the miniconda. In the home directory (/home/alexey) do the following
          <pre>
mkdir Conda
cd Conda/
wget https://repo.continuum.io/miniconda/Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh .
sh ./Miniconda2-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
          </pre>
          The miniconda will be installed into "/home/alexey/miniconda2". You will be prompted to add this path to the
          .bashrc file. If you do this, you don't need the do the next step.
        </li>

        <li>
          If you select not to include the conda path to your PATH variable, you can create an alias which you'll need to
          invoke before you call conda. In the .bashrc file, you'l add:
<pre>
alias c='export PATH=${HOME}/miniconda2/bin:$PATH'
</pre>
         You'll have to reload the terminal for the changes to take effect, or you could simply:
<pre>source .bashrc 
</pre>
        After you've added the alias
        </li>

        <li>Create conda environment (name it "libra") and activate it
          <pre>
c
conda create -n libra
source activate libra
          </pre>

          In this example, the environment will be created at: "/home/alexey/miniconda2/envs/libra". In the following steps,
          we'll need to know it.
        </li>

        <li>Install all the dependencies into the presently active conda environment ("libra" in this example)
          <pre>
conda install python=2.7
conda install conda-build
conda install gcc-lunux-64
conda install gxx-lunux-64
conda install make
conda install boost
conda install cmake
          </pre>
        </li>

        <li>Navigate to the root of the Libra code (the one with the folders like: src, tests, and so on), create the folder 
          for binary files (results of compilation and linking). Prepare the make files (it is important to pass two variables
          to cmake: DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, which should point to the correspondingly used prefix, and the other one, DCMAKE_AR, which 
          should be set to the presently used archiver (needed for creating static libraries))
          <pre>
cd /mnt/c/cygwin/home/Alexey-user/Programming/Project_libra
mkdir _build 
cd _build
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/home/alexey/miniconda2/envs/libra -DCMAKE_AR=${AR} ../
make 
          </pre>
        </li>

        <li>Add the following environment variables in .bash_profile
          <pre>
export PYTHONPATH=/mnt/c/cygwin/home/Alexey-user/Programming/Project_libra/_build/src:$PYTHONPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mnt/c/cygwin/home/Alexey-user/Programming/Project_libra/_build/src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          </pre>         
          Load the settings so the changes take effect
          <pre>source .bash_profile</pre>
        </li>

        <li>Activate the environment and use the code
          <pre>
c
conda activate libra
          </pre>
        </li>

        <li>
          If you have updated your Libra installation and the only changes made to the code concern Python
          files (e.g. in the libra_py folder), the only build instructions that are needed are (from within
          the _build directory)
<pre>
cmake ../
make copy-libra-py
<pre>
          Which will merely copy the Python files from the /src directory in the root to the /src in the build folder.
        </li>

      </ol>
      
 
      <h3>Operation system specific instructions</h3><br>

      <h4>Linux</h4><br>
      <p>
        Pretty much as written above
      </p>


      <h4>Windows (via WSL)</h4><br>
      <p>
        The most straightforward way to install Libra on Window is via the
        <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/commandline/learn-about-windows-console-and-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl/" target="_new">
        Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
        </a>
        which is now available on Windows 10. 
        To install the WSL, follow
        <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10" target="_new"> these instructions</a>       
      </p>
      <p> 
        Then follow the instructions above
      </p>

      <h4>Windows (via Cygwin)</h4><br>
      <p>
        I haven't yet figured out how to install Libra on Cygwin with the conda support
        You can build Libra without conda, in which case the instructions will look like:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <p>Edit the CMakeLists.txt in the Libra rood directory as:</p>
          <pre>
#  ADD_DEFINITIONS("-Wall")       # comment this line
ADD_DEFINITIONS("-Wall -DCYGWIN") # uncomment this line
          </pre> 
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            Assuming you are in the Libra root directory, create the "_build" folder (can be named otherwise),
            switch into it and run cmake and make
          </p>
          <pre>
mkdir _build
cd _build
cmake ../
make          
          </pre>
          <p>
            Occasionally, you may need to tell cmake where to look for the Boost and Python include and library files.
            For Python, this is taken care of by the -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR and -DPYTHON_LIBRARY options to cmake. For
            instance, on my (AVA) system the libraries (python.2.6.exe and libpython.2.6.dll) are located in 
            /home/Alexey_2/Soft/python2.6/bin , whereas the include files (such as Python.h ans bunch of other files) 
            are located in /home/Alexey_2/Soft/python2.6/include/python2.6 So, for the cmake to generate a 
            proper Makefile, I would call the cmake with the corresponding arguments:
          </p>
          <pre>
cmake -DPYTHON_INCLUDE_DIR=/home/Alexey_2/Soft/python2.6/include/python2.6 -DPYTHON_LIBRARY=/home/Alexey_2/Soft/python2.6/bin ../
          </pre>
          The same situation applies to Boost libraries and include files.
        </li>

        <li>Add the following environment variables in the (Cygwin) .bash_profile 
          <pre>
export PYTHONPATH=/home/Alexey-user/Programming/Project_libra/_build/src:$PYTHONPATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/home/Alexey-user/Programming/Project_libra/_build/src:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
          </pre>         
          Load the settings so the changes take effect
          <pre>source .bash_profile</pre>
          You are ready to use the code
        </li>

      </ol><br>


      <h3>Content of the root directory</h3>
      <p>
        The root directory contains the following items:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>src</b> - this is the directory containing the source code to be compiled
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>tests</b> - this directory contains a collections of what I call test-tutorials. 
            Each test-tutorial both helps the developer to verify and validate the implementation, 
            so it is usually created along the way of implementing the new feature of the Libra code. 
            Once finished by the developer, the resulting testing script becomes a tutorial script - showing
            a new user the implemented features and how to use them. Along the way, other features of the Libra
            package maybe showcased, contributing to further learning of the new user. 
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>doc</b> - the directory containing some documentation and theory regarding the methods implemented in Libra
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>cmake</b> - the cmake scripts for finding some necessary packages - not yet fully functional, 
            will be taken care of later
          </p>
        </li>
      
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>.gitignore</b> - we use GIT tool to control the versioning of the code and keep track the history of 
            the development. This file simply excludes some types of the files we may have in the development 
            directory (here and in all deeper levels). Usually, these are object files or other large and temporary
            files (e.g. output of test calculations, etc.). By listing these types of files in the .gitignore, we 
            are telling th git system to not worry about tracking of the changes of these files. The dot in the beginning
            of the filename makes this file "invisible" (hides it) on the Unix-type systems. This minimizes the chances 
            you delete it unintentionally.
          </p>
        </li>

        <li>
          <p>
            <b>CMakeLists.txt</b> - this is the main file that defines how to build the Libra code using the cmake utility.
            It defines all external packages, setups, options, etc. You need to customize it for your particular environment.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ul>
